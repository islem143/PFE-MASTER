[1.150s] To avoid accidental inclusion of unwanted files or directories,
[1.150s] setuptools will not proceed with this build.
[1.150s] 
[1.150s] If you are trying to create a single distribution with multiple packages
[1.150s] on purpose, you should not rely on automatic discovery.
[1.150s] Instead, consider the following options:
[1.150s] 
[1.150s] 1. set up custom discovery (`find` directive with `include` or `exclude`)
[1.150s] 2. use a `src-layout`
[1.150s] 3. explicitly set `py_modules` or `packages` with a list of names
[1.150s] 
[1.150s] To find more information, look for "package discovery" on setuptools docs.
